Obligatory first post to test out how GitHub Pages handles them. Seems simple so far, but I obliously haven't seen the results yet.

Going to set some future plans here since the rest of the blog is quite minimalist so this post seems like prime real estate for it.

- Try to change sidebar to have icons instead of links (github, rss, etc...);
- Make default font a bit darker, this gray doesnt have much contrast so it makes trying to read it a chore;
- Try to not devolve into just posts of Danny DeVito's masterpiece: "gaming" tweet;

Also, out of curiosity, how do tables look like?
