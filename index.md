## Welcome to "gaming"

`truly an afterthought of a "blog"`

Unecessary quotation marks aside, this is mostly a personal game log where I post an ingame status picture and share some thoughts. Hell, if I'm feeling it I might even give it a reccomendation.

I also (try to) make some games, you can find them all at [my itch.io page](https://kyozm.itch.io/) or on the sidebar if I can be bothered to add it there and also update it.

## About me

Yeah, nah. My favorite game is Dark Souls and that's my only personality trait. (Terraria is a close second)
